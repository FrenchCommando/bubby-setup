<i>If you’re moving, call us at least a week beforehand to start, stop, or transfer your service to a new location. We ask for 5-7 days notice so we can schedule a crew member to visit your home and physically turn your service on or off. Schedule your appointment at 1-718-643-4050, on Monday – Friday, 8am-8pm and Saturday 9:00am-5:00pm.</i>
