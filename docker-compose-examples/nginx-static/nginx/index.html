<li>National Grid: phone call - friendly, able to put 2 names</li>
<i>If you’re moving, call us at least a week beforehand to start, stop, or transfer your service to a new location. We ask for 5-7 days notice so we can schedule a crew member to visit your home and physically turn your service on or off. Schedule your appointment at 1-718-643-4050, on Monday – Friday, 8am-8pm and Saturday 9:00am-5:00pm.</i>

Need an actual person to come in and turn on the gas if it was off. 
<br><br>

<li>ConEd: still want to keep our lights on, so <i>Start New Service</i> instead of <i>Move Service</i></li>
Ask for identification, state ID works
<br>
Setup AutoPay, so keep your account/routing number ready. 
<br><br>

<li>Verizon Fios:</li>
Very confusing website. <br>
Everything goes through a tiny chat window. <br>
Many verification emails - but quite straight forward<br>
Soft credit check. <br>
Always need to setup appointment for installation - gets busy when it's busy - $99 fee, usually waived (they don't waive it automatically for online orders anymore, now have to use 1Gig offer) <br>
Setup AutoPay, so keep your account/routing number ready. <br>
Actively pushing their 1Gig over their lower speed offers.
